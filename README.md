# Blocktree

instead of chain of blocks (blockchain), have a tree of blocks.

anytime someone can branch off.  

a branch off is like a different chain.  although everything stayed on the same universe.  it is a blocktree implementation that allows parallel truth.  anyone can choose which reality (which chain) to believe in.

pos (proof-of-stake) system may have "nothing-at-stake" problem where consensus is not achieved.  
the system exploits that, now we just have parallel truth going on.  

a simple implementation might do this:
- give each reality a number
- if someone got branched off the reality number 1 depth 30 reality number 2.  might be named 1-30'2.  other naming scheme may be possible.
